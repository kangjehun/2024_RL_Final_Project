## Setup
Execute the following commands to set up a conda environment to run experiments
```bash
conda create -n crossq python=3.11.5
conda activate crossq
conda install -c nvidia cuda-nvcc=12.3.52

pip install -e .
pip install "jax[cuda12_pip]==0.4.19" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html
```

## Running Experiments
The main entry point for running experiments is `train.py`. You can configure experiments with the appropriate environment and agent flags. For more info run `python train.py --help`.

To train **with WandB logging**, run the following command to train a CrossQ agent on the `Humanoid-v4` environment with seed `9`, which will log the results to your WandB entity and project:
```bash
python train.py -algo crossq -env Humanoid-v4 -seed 9 -wandb_mode 'online' -wandb_entity my_team -wandb_project crossq
```
To train **without WandB logging**, run the following command, and in a different terminal run `tensorboard --logdir logs` to visualize training progress:
```bash
python train.py -algo crossq -env Humanoid-v4 -seed 9 -wandb_mode 'disabled'
```

To train **on a cluster**, we provide examples of slurm scripts in `/slurm` to run various experiments, baselines and ablations performed in the paper on a slurm cluster.
These configurations are very cluster specific and probably need to be adjusted for your specific cluster. However, they should surve as a starting point.
